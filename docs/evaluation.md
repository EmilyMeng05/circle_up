## General Information ##
These are the most up to date data (We updated our sus, usability, and learnbility score). We did ask more people to do the sus testing after we renovate our app based on previous feedback on the sus testing and peer audit. Additionally, we also remove some repeating scores just to show a more diverse data. 

## Method of testing ##
We used the 10 questions and 5 responses provided in class. We gave the user our app without interfereing much, and let them explore the app for 5 minutes 
# Questions: 
1. I think that I would like to use this [project] frequently.
2. I found the [project] unnecessarily complex.
3. I thought the [project] was easy to use.
4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this [project].
5. I found the various functions in this [project] were well integrated.
6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this [project].
7. I imagine that most people would learn to use this [project] very quickly.
8. I found the [project] very cumbersome to use.
9. I felt very confident using the [project].
10.I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this [project].

## Results reflection ##
Overall, we are pretty happy with how the score turned out. Our SUS score shows that we are doing quite well with our app, achieving a score of 80.3, which is close to the excellent mark. 

The usability subscore indicates that we developed a generally usable app. However, we did receive lower points in this area because some SUS testers mentioned that they don’t like to use the alarm feature on their phones and therefore aren’t interested in a group alarm app. Our main target users are people who want to use an alarm and make their waking-up routine more interesting, so we understand why our usability scores were lower in some cases.During the SUS testing, we didn’t ask why some users who indicated they don’t want to use alarms dislike alarm features. Understanding their preferences might help us improve the app and find ways to engage those users.

The learnability subscore is slightly lower than the previous two, coming in at 71.88, which is just okay. We received a lot of suggestions for this part. Specifically, some testers noted that it would be beneficial for us to add a navigation bar or tools that explain the functionalities of certain views. They also expressed confusion over why they need to register for an account when using an alarm app. We’ve set these improvements as stretch goals to implement in the future, aiming to enhance the overall user experience.
