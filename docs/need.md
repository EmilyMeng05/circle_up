## Identifying the Need ##
Waking up is something we all do—but for many, it’s one of the hardest parts of the day. We chose to address a common issue faced especially by students and young adults: the struggle to wake up on time and start the day with intention and routine.

A major reason for this is sleep inertia which is the grogginess and mental fog that can last for up to 30 minutes after waking up as defined by Dr. Michael Breus at Sleep Doctor. He also states that this state of inertia can significantly reduce alertness and motivation, making it harder to take action—like getting out of bed. In response to the wake up call of an alarm ringing in our ears, we turn to hitting the snooze button because it feels like the easy option—but that can actually make things worse. As Dr. Stuart Peirson explains, hitting snooze disrupts the sleep cycle and may increase drowsiness rather than help fight it.
Traditional alarm clocks don’t help much—they just play a sound and hope for the best. With no real accountability or external motivation, it’s no surprise that users keep snoozing or sleeping through them.

But there’s strong evidence that social support and accountability can drive meaningful behavior change. In an article by Sweet Institute, Dr. Mardoche Sidor mentions that people are far more likely to stick to their goals when their actions are shared or observed by others. Small tasks, when combined with group motivation, have also been shown to increase follow-through and help build long-term habits.

That’s where our app comes in. We designed Circle Up to work with—not against—human behavior. By combining an alarm system with light, engaging tasks and social accountability, users are encouraged to get up right away. There’s only a limited window to complete the task and “check in” with the group—removing the temptation to endlessly snooze and replacing it with a sense of shared responsibility.
